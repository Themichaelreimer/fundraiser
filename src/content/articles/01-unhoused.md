text: It's tempting to look at the problem of houselessness and think that's just the way it is. The way it always has been, but has it? Must things remain this way? Being unhoused is a condition that describes individuals, families, or communities without housing, or the means of securing housing that is stable, safe, that has some	semblance of permanency, and is appropriate. The problem is complex on an individual, and on a societal level. Individually, a person or a household's financial situation, mental or physical challenges, including addiction and/or racism, and discrimination can all play a part. On the societal level there are systematic barriers, and a shortage of affordable and appropriate housing. Public misconceptions also play a large role in perpetuating the barriers that face those who are affected.
