text: Having learnt what we can, can we elevate people experiencing houselessness on our list of priorities? If we did, where would that lead us? Would we take the time to write to our elected representatives on the municipal, provincial, and federal levels to let them know our concerns? Perhaps participate in a peaceful demonstration? Promote understanding? Show compassion? Volunteer? Give? Support a fundraiser? What if we all did just a little? This is the question that gave birth to the "Autumn Song Concert and Art Auction". It has grown from that question to an idea to a scheduled event. It's come this far because so many musicians,	artists, and vollunteers have stepped up to make it happen. Now we need you to help bring it home. Come join us	on October 4th. Enjoy the music, bid on art, show your support, and be a part of the solution.
