text: It's visible in the news headlines. The gap between rich and poor is expanding. Housing costs have skyrocketed and continue to climb. Good jobs are under threat of disappearance as A.I. research seeks to improve profitability at all costs. Social safety nets are also under attack and often the subject of hot, politically charged, debate. More and more average workers struggle with keeping ahead of their bills and, as a result, there is a growing number of people who are living only one financial upset away from becoming unhoused. The problem has reached and surpassed the critical stage. We have travelled from a place where social safety nets were adequate to prevent most houselessness to one where emergency shelters are needed for large numbers of our neighbors. We're trying to put out fires as the flames continue to be fanned, and the wind is in our face.
