text: In Canada, prior to 1980, it was rare to hear of someone who was living unhoused. What is it that has changed so much? Around the time the last world war ended many Canadians were living in poor-quality and overcrowded conditions. Adequate housing for all became a priority	and our government introduced many initiatives to try to make that goal a reality. In 1973 amendments to the National Housing Act saw 20,000 units of social housing being built every year. In the early 1980s there was a shift in government priorities, and a drifting away from the ideals of collective responsibility, toward policies that favored private business interests. In 1984 cuts to social housing and other programs began. In 1993 Canada's government stopped all federal funding for social housing and in 1996 transferred all responsibility for affordable housing to the provinces. The theory behind cuts to social services is that by focusing on building prosperity and a strong economy in which Canadian busnesses can succeed all our needs would be met, including the needs of	our most vulnerable, through a trickle-down economy. Our collective quest to have a competitive economy	continues to this day to erode our social safety nets and has led to increasing numbers of Canadians becoming dehoused. There is an ever-widening gap between the rich and the poor leaving more at risk. Gone are the days	when two hours of unskilled labour would provide a roof over one's head for the night. In almost all cases, those who are unhoused simply do not have the resources to get themselves out of that situation. It's not their choice,	it's not their fault. Pulling oneself up by one's own bootstraps actually describes something that's just not posible.
