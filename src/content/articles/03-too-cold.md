text: People caught in the trap of being without housing often face insurmountable barriers for them to overcome on their own. Gainful employment could be a solution for some but, even for those who have skills and abilities that employers are looking for, finding work can prove to be nearly impossible. It's hard to present yourself well in an interview when you don't have access to a shower or laundry facilities or if you're not able to provide a home address to a potential employer. This problem is often compounded by health challenges, both mental and/or physical. Being without housing, in itself, is traumatic and demoralizing, and can lead to depression and other ailments that add to the hopelessness of the situation. Breaking the cycle requires not only adequate housing, but also, appropriate and ongoing supports for each individual or group.
