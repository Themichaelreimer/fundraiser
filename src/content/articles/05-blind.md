text: The problem is not exclusively our government's to solve. There's more for us to do than cast our ballot once every four years or so and hope for the best. The attitude that, once elected, it' all up to the politicians to make things right is so wrong. This thinking allows us to dismiss the problem and, more profoundly, the people living in unhoused conditions, as someone else's problem. Deflecting responsibility makes it easy for us to turn	away from the unhoused adding to one of their biggest obstacles, isolation. Looking away, instead of learning about, breeds misconceptions and stereotypes, and places those who lack adequate shelter low on our list of	priorities. This in turn affects how we vote and, through polling, it affects the platform parties run on creating a cycle that feeds on itself. The first step in changing this is educating ourselves. A good place to start is with the <a href="https://preventhomelessness.ca/" class="underline text-blue-500">Canadian Observatory on Homelessness website.</a> They have several publications available on a number related topics. In Winnipeg an excellent source of information is the <a href="https://endhomelessnesswinnipeg.ca/" class="underline text-blue-500">End Homelessness Winnipeg</a> website. There you will find comprehensive listings of organizations that provide services for the unhoused as well as information and news about local happenings. It's also a great place to shop for an organization where you can help with donations or through volunteering.
