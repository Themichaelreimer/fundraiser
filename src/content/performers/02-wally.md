name: "Wally Landreth"
description: Wally Landreth has been writing songs, playing music and working as a side man, a front man and solo performer for ever.Â  Long in tooth, short in patience and full of stories that without music are just lies. Or dreams. You can decide for yourself. He went to Cub Scouts in the basement of the old John Black church. There was a yellow light bulb that was supposed to be the moon and a sad stuffed wolf head on top of a coat rack.
