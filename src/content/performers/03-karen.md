name: "Karen Hammerstrand"
description: Karen learned later in life that she loves song writing, and so she spends time writing songs that are mostly kind of folky, jazzy, or bluesy. She has released 2 albums, Late Blooming (2015) and Still Life (2023). She also loves to perform, from duos and trios to full bands, at a variety of venues and festivals around our great province. You can go to <a class="underline text-blue-500" href="http://karenhammarstrand.com">her website</a>, to Spotify or Youtube to check out some of her music if you like.
