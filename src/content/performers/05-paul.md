name: "Paul Cammeron Miller"
description: Miller’s guitar playing has elicited comparisons with some of the worlds best. He has developed techniques that raise the bar considerably. His two full length recordings were released to critical praise, at the same time introducing a new audience to Miller’s visual work, as he was responsible for the artwork, layout and design. Paul has been teaching his craft, primarily music, for two and a half decades. He has been responsible for sparking the flame under hundreds of young players. Some, like John K. Samson and Stephan Carroll of The Weakerthans, move on to international recognition, all the while retaining the important bits of information acquired at Crawlspace Recording, Paul’s studio facility.  <br/><br/><span class="font-bold">Press Quotes</span><br/> <span class="italic">“A deep well of talent.
