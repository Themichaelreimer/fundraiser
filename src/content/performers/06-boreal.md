name: "Boreal Chorus"
description: Boreal Chorus is a quartet born from a shared passion for simple, timeless melodies and authentic storytelling. Their music, a mix of original compositions and covers, is a vehicle for connection, community, self and collective care, and fun. Drawing inspiration from a diverse range of experience within Winnipeg’s music scene, each member brings their own unique style to the group. Boreal Chorus creates an inviting space where strings and song come together to offer something more than the sum of its parts—a home for both the musicians and their listeners.
