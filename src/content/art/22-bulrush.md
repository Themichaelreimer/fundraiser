name: Bulrush
description: One pair of bulrush wall hangings simply hand crafted of all-natural wood.  Wood in wood inlay uses many woods based on their natural color and grain structure. No color is added to alter its appearance.  The pieces I use are inlayed a minimum of 1/8 in. min (this is not Marquetry which is pictures of very thin wood veneers). Hang pieces in a shaded place or wall. Do not expose them to direct SUNLIGHT. Natural wood will change color rapidly if exposed to ultraviolet light. Kept in the shade colors will last for years. Each piece measures approximately 9 ½ by 4 ½ by 7/8 of an inch.
