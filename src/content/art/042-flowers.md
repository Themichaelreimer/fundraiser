name: '"Untitled" by Bev Gray' 
description: I have always made art. I love drawing and painting and creating works such as fibre art and snow sculpture. This painting represents a detour from my exploration of the connection between people and nature, and people and each other. The piece (16”X20”/ untitled) is a still life of flowers. The materials I used include acrylic on canvas with acrylic medium and fabric. I choose the painting because it fills me with joy!<br/><br/><b>Size:</b> 16x20 inches <br/><b>Medium:</b> Acrylic and Fabric <br/> <b>Starting bid:</b> $60
