name: 7 Sleepers
description: 7 Sleepers, a legend shared by Christian and Islamic communities about 7 young men who fall asleep in a cave to escape persecution and wake centuries later, inspired this painting. Seven men sleep under the star amongst dandelions. Dandelions, a favorite symbol. They will grow anywhere and they heal the land. Plus you can make a wish. They also represent overcoming oppression to me as Reclaiming holds a Dandelion Conference every two years to consider such things. <br/><br/><b>Size:</b> 20x16Â¼ inches <br/><b>Medium:</b> Watercolour & Acrylic on Canvas <br/> <b>Starting bid:</b> $110
