name: Polaroid Ironing (1978) by 
description: Aganetha Dyck (September 12, 1937 – July 18, 2025) was a Canadian sculptor from Winnipeg. In 1977, while walking the streets of Winnipeg, she discovered a few Polaroids run over by a car, causing the emulsion to squeeze out and form interesting patterns. She began experimenting with her own Polaroids, freezing and ironing them to create distorted images. The &quot;Polaroid Ironings&quot; are mentioned in the January 1985 issue of &quot;Border Crossings&quot; magazine. Dyck received the Governor General’s Award in Visual and Media Arts in 2007. The Winnipeg Art Gallery is hosting an exhibition in her honor until April 26, 2026. https://www.wag.ca/exhibitions/celebrating-aganetha-dyck/ <br/><br/><b>Size:</b> 7.5x7.5  inches <br/><b>Medium:</b> Polaroid Film <br/> <b>Starting bid:</b> $300
