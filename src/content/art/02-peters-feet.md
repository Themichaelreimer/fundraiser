name: "Peter's Feet"
description: "Linocut with watercolour of bare feet, covered in tattoos. I asked Peter, a friend of my brothers and of my ex, if I could draw his feet one day when we were hanging out as a group. This was to go with a poem I wrote about homelessness, focusing on feet. Many people I know have struggled with not having an adequate place to live at some point in their lives and also with addiction. I don't know where Peter is now. I hope he is well.<br/><br/><b>Size:</b> 14x11 inches <br/><b>Medium:</b> Linocut with watercolour <br/> <b>Starting bid:</b> $85"
